                  Introduced to computer programming for the first time. After realizing Pittstate didn't have any sufficient 
                  curiculum relating to computer science, I left for the School of Engineering at the University of Kansas.

                  Developed high-end applications using C++, Java, Python, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.
                  Gained experience as a developer, mathematician, and tutor which resulted in exceptional analytical, 
                  problem-solving, communication, and interpersonal skills. Learned to work independently, recognizing 
                  patterns/problems and developing/implementing solutions while also able to collaborate with a team, 
                  managing and delegating tasks both appropriately and efficiently.
