                  Playing outside linebacker for PSU is what initially lured me there,
                  as well as it's proximity to my hometown (Carl Junction). Thus, not long
                  after hanging up my cleats for good I found myself transferring to KU's 
                  School of Engineering.

                  Prior to KU I had only been introduced to assembly language and
                  small dose of C. Being introduced to high-level programming languages
                  for the first time was quite exciting. Starting in our first 
                  programming course where we wrote java applications using eclipse IDE and 
                  ran them on our provided android tablets. Or another course where I used 
                  javascript to develop the game snake in the browser. <br>
